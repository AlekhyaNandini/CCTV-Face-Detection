# CCTV-Face-Detection
This project processes CCTV footage to detect and extract faces using the YOLOv8 object detection model. It identifies persons in video frames, crops the upper portion of each bounding box as the face region, and saves these face images at regular intervals (every 2 seconds) to reduce redundancy.
